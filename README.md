# Language Switcher

Language Switcher is a simple utility created to alternate between French and Spanish on a daily basis.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to automate the process of switching between French and Spanish languages on a daily basis. It was developed for personal use and may not have active contribution opportunities.

## How It Works

The `lang-switcher` utility is designed to be run on a schedule using a task scheduler or cron job. It will automatically change the language setting in your system from French to Spanish and vice versa.
